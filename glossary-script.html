<div class="divTableCell">
    Grip - Hinge The "Grip-Hinge" is the foundation fundamental to a consistent, powerful and accurate swing. The correct postioning of the grip and the ideal
    movement of the hinge make it the easiest to create a repeatable powerful and accurate swing.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Hand - Arm Action The "Hinge to Hinge" hitting action for the swing, also known has “L to L”. This happens in the backswing and the follow through where
    the wrists move from a 90-degree angle (to the lead arm) at the top of the backswing, to almost straight at impact, and then return to a 90-degree angle
    (to the trail arm) at the top of the follow through.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Magic Move to Consistent Accuracy The "connected" lead arm is pulled through the hitting zone while staying "connected" to the chest: This creates a
    consistent club head path delivery through impact leading to consistent accuracy.

<div class="divTableCell">
    The Fast Track System A power and accuracy enhancing training set for low handicap players and Pros.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Turns The turning of the body during the swing. The wind-up of the shoulders in the backswing and then the unwinding of the hips-shoulders sequence in the
    downsiwng and through the hitting zone into the finsh position. Shoulders-Hips-Shoulders!


    Day 2
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Ball Flight Laws There are 5 factors occuring at impact that determine where the ball flies : 1. Clubface Position 2. Clubhead Path 3. Clubhead Speed 4.
    Centerness of Contact 5. Clubhead Angle of Ascent/Descent. By watching the ball fly one can determine what actually happened at impact and then use this
    knowledge to make corrections.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Club Head Speed In particular, it's the club head speed at impact.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Club Face The part of the club head that you strike the golf ball with.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    De-Loft The club is "De-Lofted" when it impacts the ball with less loft (angle of the club skyward) than the club is designed to be hit with. This happens
    when there is an excessive leaning of the shaft target-ward at impact.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Hinge During the backswing the wrists "hinge" or "cock" achieving the desired 90-degree angle between the lead arm and the shaft.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Left Outer Step Outside edge of your left foot.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Load The "Load" is generally referring to the pressure created on the wrists (lead thumb) during the tranisition into the downwing. This will bend or bow
    the shaft, setting one up for a powerful snap of the club head into and through impact.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Miracle Swing This GSM specific "Master" drill trains the optimal turning of the shoulders, the clubface relationship to its path through impact and the
    optimal one-piece "connected" takeaway.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Object of the Swing The object of the swing is to hit the ball on the center of the clubface, get the club head path and club face going toward the target
    with a lot of clubhead speed for power.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Optimal Posture The "Optimal Setup Posture" is the body posture position before the swing and into impact. A 45-degree angle is formed from the top half of
    the spine to the ground at address and at the same time the spine is at a 45-degree angle to the lead arm.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Optimal Track The most effective club head path for the club to travel on during the golf swing.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Quiet Hands The hands remain as a solid unit before and through the hitting zone. This keeps the clubface square and eliminates the possibility of flipping
    the wrists and hands, which will cause the ball to travel off the intended target line.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Right Instep The inside of the right foot. This is where the shoulder turn is "wound" around, during the backswing.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Swing Path The path the clubhead takes when swinging the golf club. This refers most particularly to the delivery of the clubhead through the hittng zone.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Swing Plane The path that the clubhead is traveling on during the backswing, downswing and follow through.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Take Away The "One-Piece Connected Take Away” is the crucial element in the start of the golf swing. It gets the backswing on the same track consistently,
    leading to more consistent accuracy.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Transition Torque During the transition from the top of the backswing into the start of the downswing there are three slight stretches or "torques" that
    occur. The hip turn stretches the lead side lats, the shoulder turn stretches the arm-shoulder lever and the arm stretches the wrist lever. Done in the
    correct sequence, this creates a powerful 1-2-3 acceleration of the clubhead into impact, maximizing power potential.


    Day 3
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Arc Width The "Arc Width" is the measured width of the clubhead's path when viewing the golfer from face-on. The widest possible arc width is created by a
    one-unit connected triangle takeaway in the backswing and is critical to maximizing power.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Clubface Position Where the clubface is in relation to the clubhead path. Key check positions are: at address, halfway back, at the top of the swing,
    halfway down and most importantly, at impact.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Critical Skills Check points that are crucial elements to mastering the golf swing. It is a great idea to learn these "Critical Skills" well. They will be
    a vital help in identifying and avoiding common swing mistakes as one develops.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Eye-Line The "Eye-line" is where the eyes are lined up in relation to the ball and the target line during the set-up, just before the takeaway.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Face Rotation "Face Rotation" is the movement of the clubface, relative to its path, during the golf swing. GSM will train the movements needed to
    eliminate excessive club face rotation, leading to more consistent accuracy.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Grip Check A GSM exclusive procedure that checks for and ensures the proper grip clubface relationship relative to the swing. It ensures a square to swing
    clubface at the start of the swing.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Grip Faults The faults in the grip that are due to improper grip application or contact during the swing. These grip faults will cause errors in ball
    flight and lead to the development of less than ideal compensations during the swing motion.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Hinge During the backswing the wrists "hinge" or "cock" achieving the desired 90-degree angle between the lead arm and the shaft.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    L-Shape The 90-degree angle between your club and the left arm at the top of the backswing.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Level Elbows From a down-the-line view: a line drawn across the the elbows should be approximatly level to the ground, both at the top of the swing and at
    the end of the follow through.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Neutral Grip This is the ideal grip position. Not too "Weak" (turned to the left) or "Strong" (turned to the right).
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Posture The combination of upper body tilt toward the ball, knee flex and arm position at address and during the swing. The upper spine should be
    approximately 45 degrees.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Re-routing "Re-Routing" happens when the swing plane, or clubhead path, travels on a different path in the backswing and in the downswing.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Stable Base The feet are planted solidly into the ground at the in-steps at the setup and during the backswing.This is done in order to inhibit unecessary
    or erratic movement of the legs during the backswing or downswing. Erratic leg movement or instability is a main cause of many shot faults.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Stance Width The distance between the feet when the ball is addressed. The feet should be wide enough to keep one stable during the swing, but narrow
    enough to turn through the ball to the finish with the body facing the target easily.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Strong Grip (turned to right) This is when the whole grip is turned to the “right” on the club or the right hand is too far “under” the club (right
    handers). This can cause the club face to close to its path through the hitting area, producing a hook.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Swing Plane The path that the clubhead is traveling on during the backswing, downswing and follow through.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Transition Torque During the transition from the top of the backswing into the start of the downswing there are three slight stretches or "torques" that
    occur. The hip turn stretches the lead side lats, the shoulder turn stretches the arm-shoulder lever and the arm stretches the wrist lever. Done correctly
    this creates a powerful 1-2-3 acceleration of the clubhed into impact, maximizing power potential.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Turning of the Shoulders The backswing should start with turning of the body: The hips and shoulders together. The hips stop first then the shoulders
    should turn approximately twice as far as the hips. Do this as apposed to starting the swing with your hands or arms. See "Take Away"
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Weak Grip (turned to the left) This is when the whole grip is turned to the “left” on the club or the right hand is too far “on top of” the club (right
    handers). This can cause the club face to open to its path through the hitting area, producing a slice.


    Day 4
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    The Miracle Swing This GSM specific "Master" drill trains the optimal turning of the shoulders, the clubface relationship to its path through impact and
    the optimal one-piece "connected" takeaway.


    Day 5
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Arc Width The "Arc Width" is the measured width of the clubhead's path when viewing the golfer from face-on. The widest possible arc width is created by a
    one-unit connected triangle takeaway in the backswing and is critical to maximizing power.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Ball Flight Monitor An electronic "reader" the reveals ball flight characteristics such as: ball speed, club head speed, launch angle, distance, spin rate
    and curve characteristics. It is used to fit amateurs and professionals for the purpose of true shot evaluation and to optimize golf club fitting.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Double Catapult The double catapult effect happens when the transition torque "loads" or slightly stretches the arm-shoulder lever and the wrist-club lever
    creating a one-two acceleration, propelling the clubhead powerfully and automatically through impact.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Maximize Power Maximum power is achieved from direct, center of the clubface ball contact and by maximizing clubhead speed at impact. GSM's "Power
    Training" section will help achieve maximum power rapidly.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Optimal Sequencing The optimal sequencial movements for both maximum power and consistent accuracy are: Turn-Arm-Wrist (in the backswing) and then
    Turn-Arm-Wrist (in the downswing).
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Power Leaks Several "Power Leaks" are: Poor turning; starting the backswing with the hands and arms instead of the turns; Grip/Hinge faults - make sure
    grip and hinging is correct; Over-swinging - Pulling the backswing too far back with the back arm.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Power Lever The primary "Power Lever" is the hinge between the lead arm and the wrists. The defining factor is the pressure that is created on the lead
    thumb in the start of the downswing. This lever needs to be released at the bottom of the downswing into impact to maximize power.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Secret Drill / Power Loading Drill This GSM specific "Master" drill trains the "Double Catapult" effect by training the transition torque needed to
    maximize the power loading in the downswing that is to be released through impact. The swing should feel just like this drill. It integrates all three of
    these movement concepts into the swing: "The Secret to Effortless Power" - "The Automatic Hit" - "The Magic Move"
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    The Automatic Hit When the club is optimally "loaded" using "transition torque" the wrists and lead thumb are pressurized in the start of the downswing.
    This creates a "spring-like" propelling of the club through impact, which makes solid ball striking much easier do and to repeat.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    The "Secret" to Effortless Power The ideal turning sequence in the transition from the backswing into the downswing produces a "transition torque" which
    "loads" or slightly stretches the arm-shoulder lever and the wrist-club lever creating a one-two acceleration, propelling the clubhead powerfully and
    automatically through impact.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Triangle Shape The shape created by the arms and shoulders at address. This triangle shape should be maintained until the clubshaft is parallel to the
    ground in the backswing, or half way back.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Tripod Base This is where the legs stay stable while turning and have the appearance of 2 legs of a tripod or an "A-shape" at the top of the backswing.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Turn - Arm - Wrist The optimal sequence of movements during both the backswing (Turn - Arm - Wrist) and the downswing (Turn - Arm - Wrist). This sequence
    optimizes the potential for maximum power while at the same time leading to greater consistency and accuracy.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Turn Driven - Still Hands Swing This defines the goal of GSM: To use the turning of the body as the "movement source" for the swing, while at the same time
    keeping excessive hand wrist action out of the swing until the hitting zone. This swing concept will increase power and improve both consistency and
    accuracy.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Turn Driven Swing A swing where turning of the shoulders and hips are the dominant movement source for the swing. The hands and arms remain more passive
    and reactive until the hiting zone.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Wrist Lever The primary "Power Lever" is the hinge between the lead arm and the wrists. This lever needs to be released at the bottom of the downswing into
    impact to maximize power.


    Day 6
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Automatic Club Path The GSM system trains the turning of the body to consistently drive the arms, the club and clubhead on the same path. This establishes
    an "automatic" clubhead path delivery that repeats easily from swing to swing.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Circle Impact Drill This GSM specific "Master" drill trains the clubhead path and clubface delivery into impact. It also trains the ideal impact position
    relationships between the body, the arms, the hands, the club shaft and the clubface relative to the target. It trains "The Magic Move."
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Connected Turn Away The"Connected Turnaway" is achieved by turning the body to start the swing with completely passive or "quiet" hands and arms. This is
    another name for a "connected one-unit takeaway". It can also be called the "Triangle Takeaway."
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Hip - Shoulder - Turn Sequence The ideal swing sequence for both the backswing and the downswing.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Impact Position Describes the optimal position of the shoulders, hips, arms, hands and club in relation to the ball and the target at the moment of impact.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Outside-In Swing Path The swing path where the clubhead is traveling from "outside" the target line before it strkes the ball and "inside" the target line
    after it strikes the ball. This path causes a pull left (right hander) and often leads to weak slices to the right. This can be caused by improper setup or
    posture.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Inside-Out Swing Path The swing path where the clubhead is traveling from "inside" the target line before it strkes the ball and "outside" the target line
    after it strikes the ball. This path causes a push right (right hander) and often leads to hooking to the left.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Inside to Inside Swing Path Because the clubhead is traveling on a slight arc, relative to the target, this is the ideal path the club should take to get
    the club head traveling at the target at impact.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Lead Arm The left arm if you are right handed or the right arm if you are left handed.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Miracle Drill This "Master" drill trains the optimal turning of the shoulders, the clubface relationship to its path through impact and the optimal
    one-piece "connected" takeaway.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Square Clubface This refers to getting the clubface square to the path and target at impact. This "Square Clubface" can be achieved most easily by using
    the GSM sytem to train the fundamental components well.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Still Hands The hands are "still" when they are devoid of excessive hinging or rotation during the the backswing. The hands are "still" when keeping the
    clubface square to the club path for a long time through the hitting zone.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    The" Magic Move" The hip-shoulder turn sequence drives the "connected" lead arm through the hitting area. This keeps the club path and body-arm
    relationship steady making consistent accuracy the easiest to achieve.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    The Turn Hit "The Turn Hit" is hitting the ball with the turn and arm relationship remaining constant into impact. In effect, the turn and the arms are
    moving the same speed from half way down until impact.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Turning into Impact Unwinding the body "pulls" the lead arm into impact as opposed to "throwing" the arms into impact. Turning into impact will greatly
    improve accuracy and power.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Wrist Hinge During the backswing the wrists " hinge" or "cock" achieveing the 90-degree angle between the lead arm and the shaft. It's best to "swing the
    clubhead into the hinge" as opposed to consciously and actively trying to hinge the wrists. "Swinging the clubhead" in the backswing will create the ideal
    wrist hinge almost automatically.


    Day 7
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Connected Turn Away The "Connected Turnaway" is achieved by turning the body to start the swing with completely passive or "quiet" hands and arms. This is
    another name for a "connected one-unit takeaway. It can also be called the "Triangle Takeaway."
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Level Turns "Level Turns" refer to keeping the turning of the shoulders "level' to the tilted turning axis: the spine. Keeping the turns "level to the
    tilt" makes delivering the club on a repeatable path and making solid contact the easiest to repeat.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    On Plane The clubhead is "on plane" when it is on the optimal path during the golf swing. Having the club "on plane" can be determined in a "down-the-line"
    view of the swing by drawing a line from the clubhead up and through the bottom of the upper spine. Off plane club path leads to less consistent ball
    striking.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Retained Triangle The triangle shape between the shoulders and the arms in the "connected one-unit takeaway." This shape should be "retained" until half
    way back where the club is parallel to the ground.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Shaft Plane From a down-the-line view (behind the golfer): This is the path where the club shaft travels during the golf swing. This plane should stay
    between the belt line and the shoulders for most of the swing, except at the very top and very finish.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Transition Torque During the transition from the top of the backswing into the start of the downswing there are three slight stretches or "torques" that
    occur. The hip turn stretches the lead side lats, the shoulder turn stretches the arm-shoulder lever and the arm stretches the wrist lever. Done correctly
    this creates a powerful 1-2-3 acceleration of the clubhead into impact, maximizing power potential.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Tripod Base Reverse Turn The turning part of the backswing where one turns around the back leg while keeping the weight anchored on the inside of the back
    foot. This anchored leg and foot create a "tripod-like" appearance where the back hip turns slightly upward and toward the target. This also allows the
    shoulders to turn easily into their full movement potential.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Turn - Arm - Wrist The optimal sequence of movements during both the backswing (Turn - Arm - Wrist) and the downswing (Turn - Arm - Wrist). This sequence
    optimizes the potential for maximum power while at the same time leading to greater consistency and accuracy.


    Day 8
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Grip-Hinge The "Grip-Hinge" is the foundation fundamental to a consistent powerful and accurate swing. The correct postioning of the grip and the ideal
    movement of the hinge make it the easiest to create a repeatable powerful and accurate swing.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    MS Mini Beast This "indoor" golf swing training aid was designed by Gary Pinns to help golfers actually see where the club face is moving throughout the

    Day 9
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Grip Process Trains the "Foundation Fundamental - The Grip" - It's the ideal way to get the grip right! Using it will develop the grip and clubface
    relationship in an ideal manner, so the clubface is related optimally to the target at address and to the swing path throughout the swing.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Grip Check A GSM exclusive procedure that checks for and ensures the proper grip clubface relationship relative to the swing. It ensures a square to swing
    clubface at the start of the swing.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    1:30 Position The "1:30 Position" refers to where the lead thumb is placed on the club for a right hander - 12:00 would be directely on top when the
    clubface is square to the target and when the shaft points up the the lead arm to the shoulder. ( would be 10:30 for left hander)


    Day 10
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Club Load When the transition into the downswing is done in the optimal sequence, the club will “load” or slightly stretch the lead thumb and both wrists.
    This “load” causes a catapult effect, which in turn, creates an effortless stirke with maximum power.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Hinge During the backswing the wrists "hinge" or "cock" achieving the desired 90-degree angle between the lead arm and the shaft.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">
    Hinge to Hinge Also known as “L to L” - This happens in the backswing and the follow through where the wrists move from at a 90-degree angle to the lead
    arm at the top of the backswing - to almost straight at impact - and then return to a 90-degree angle to the trail arm at the top of the follow through.
    </div></div><div class="divTableRow">
<div class="divTableCell">

    Unplayable Lie The term "unplayable lie" means that the player has determined that he cannot or will not play the shot "as it lies"." The player must then
    proceed taking the appropriate penalty by dropping the ball or replaying the previous shot in the appropriate manner.

    Water Hazards A "water hazard" is a hazard that you must hit over. Usually, it is a pond or such and runs across the hole design, not along it. Yellow
    stakes or lines mark the margin of the hazard. The edge of the water defines it if there are no lines or stakes.

    Winter Rules "Winter rules" accommodate less than ideal course conditions by allowing the player to lift, clean and place his ball within a scorecard
    length of its original position, not nearer to the hole. They are called winter rules, because often in winter months, the course conditions are poor
    enough to warrant this action.

    Yardage Marker "Yardage markers" are plates or stakes that are embedded into the ground in order to help players easily determine the distance to the hole
    and to help speed up play. Yardages may also be placed on sprinkler heads to make this even easier. Yardage markers are considered obstructions from which
    you are allowed to take relief.
